<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. I moved onto the CSS, and started by importing fonts, and adding a background color for the entire webpage. Next, I started to design the card, and spent some time trying to get the small details right (such as padding, margins, font sizes etc). I then moved to styling elements like text, images, and finally the filter for the image Furthermore, I spent some time learning about adding filters to images, and how to get the right color for the filter. I used this knowledge and applied it to the design I was looking to achieve. Overall, this project allowed me to learn some new things, and further improve my vanilla CSS skills. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple broswers, and used the built in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. </p>
